# Introduction: What is Jupyter?

```{admonition} Purpose
In this section, we provide a brief overview of Jupyter, tools in the Jupyter
ecosystem and introduce you to the communities of contributors involved in the
project.

## About this resource

At workshops and town-halls, one of the recurring needs we have heard from the
EarthCube and Geoscience communities is for onboarding resources for the
Jupyter and open-source scientific python ecosystem. 

The goal of this and several following sections is to be an onboarding resource for scientists who
use computing in their research already and are interested in getting
connected with interactive computing in Jupyter. This is not a comprehensive
introduction to Python, but we will provide links and additional resources
tailored to the scientific community.

This section includes an introduction to:

- Jupyter Notebook and how it supports computational narratives
  that weave together text, code, figures and rich outputs

- other projects in the Jupyter ecosystem including JupyterLab, JupyterHub,
  JupyterBook and Binder

- components of the architecture and examples of tools that build upon it

- the contributors and users who make up the Jupyter community, and pointers to
  places to connect on forums and social media

This resource is under construction. If you have questions, are interested in
contributing to the development of tutorials, or have requests for tutorials,
please feel free to [post an
issue](https://github.com/pangeo-data/jupyter-earth/issues) on our GitHub
repository.

<!-- We start with an overview of interactive computing using Jupyter technologies
and demonstrate some aspects that are powerful in research. We then provide an
overview of components of the ecosystem including:
- JupyterLab, basic usage of the notebook, and the extension ecosystem
- IPython: using Python interactively, useful "magics" for scientific analysis & interacting with other languages
- Tips for creating reproducible work with Jupyter
- JupyterHub  for running code on shared infrastructure (cloud or HPC)
- Binder for sharing your research code in a reproducible manner
- JupyterBook for creating books with computational content
- Custimizing IPython for creating rich displays for scientific objects
- Widgets for interacting with code through graphical controls

Finally we conclude with some examples and pointers to the broader open-source ecosystem.
