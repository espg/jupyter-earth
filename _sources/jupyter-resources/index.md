# Introduction to Jupyter for Scientists

At workshops and town-halls, one of the recurring needs we have heard from the
EarthCube and Geoscience communities is for onboarding resources for the
Jupyter and open-source scientific python ecosystem.

```{admonition} Purpose
The goal of this resource is to be an onboarding resource for scientists who
use computing in their research already and are interested in getting
connected with interactive computing in Jupyter. This is not a comprehensive
introduction to Python, but we will provide links and additional resources
tailored to the scientific community.
```

We start with an overview of interactive computing using Jupyter technologies
and demonstrate some aspects that are powerful in research. We then provide an
overview of components of the ecosystem including:
- JupyterLab, basic usage of the notebook, and the extension ecosystem
- IPython: using Python interactively, useful "magics" for scientific analysis & interacting with other languages
- Tips for creating reproducible work with Jupyter
- JupyterHub  for running code on shared infrastructure (cloud or HPC)
- Binder for sharing your research code in a reproducible manner
- JupyterBook for creating books with computational content
- Custimizing IPython for creating rich displays for scientific objects
- Widgets for interacting with code through graphical controls

Finally we conclude with some examples and pointers to the broader open-source ecosystem.
