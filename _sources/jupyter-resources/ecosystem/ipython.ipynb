       "  because they aren't really valid Python code, so you can't exec them.\n",
       "\n",
       "* Output caching system:\n",
       "\n",
       "  For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input\n",
       "  cache exists but using _ instead of _i. Only actions that produce a result\n",

       "* Directory history:\n",
       "\n",
