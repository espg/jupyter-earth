```{admonition} Purpose

This section provides an introduction to core tools in the Jupyter ecosystem
with demonstrations of them in action in geoscience applications.

```

Ths section includes an introduction to:

- JupyterLab, navigating the JupyterLab interfaces and an introduction to
  extensions that are useful for scientific work

- The use and features that IPython adds for interactive computing

- How IPython can be customized with a focus on rich displays for scientific
  objects

- Using widgets to connect graphical controls such as slidebars and toggle
  buttons to your code

- Managing state in your notebook and tips for communicating your work in a
  reproducible manner

- Running JupyterLab on shared computational infrastructure (e.g. the cloud or
  High Performance Computing facilities)

- Sharing a repository of notebooks so others can run them with Binder

- Turning a collection of notebooks into a web-based book with Jupyter Book
