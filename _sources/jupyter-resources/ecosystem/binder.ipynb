    "\n",
    "[mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) and [binder.pangeo.io](https://binder.pangeo.io) provide public binders where you can create a link to an interactive session with your code. The image below shows the interface for [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org). The Pangeo Binder interface is very similar and has additional functionality for launching a Dask-Kubernetes cluster for distributed computation. \n",

    "### Step 1: Specify Repository Location\n",
    "\n",
    "If your repository is public on GitHub, as a Gist, on GitLab, Zenodo, Fighare or and of the locations in the first dropdown menu, the first step is to paste the URL into the first entry box. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you enter this, the URL in the \"Copy the URL below and share your Binder with others\" will begin to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<username>/<repository>/HEAD```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 (Optional): Specify a specific branch, tag or commit \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a specific branch, tag or commit you would like built, you can enter that here. For example to build the `main` branch, you enter `main` and the URL will update to \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<username>/<repository>/main```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 (Optional): Specify the path to a notebook or URL for a different interface \n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like a specific notebook to open when a user launches, you can specify that here. For example, if I want to point users to a summary notebook called `index.ipynb`, then on the right, I set the dropdown to \"File\", enter `index.ipynb` and the URL will update to \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<username>/<repository>/main?filepath=index.ipynb```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you wanted to open in JupyterLab rather than the notebook (the current default), you can change the dropdown on the right to \"URL\" and enter `lab`. The URL will then update to \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/<username>/<repository>/main?urlpath=lab```\n",
